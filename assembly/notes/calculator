Calculator Notes_________________________

- may be precipitous to change calculator platform
    - TI86 appears to be in process of being discontinued
    - Newer calculators have more memory and are much faster
    - Newer calculators are cheaper
    - Newer calculators have C compilers available
- considerations to changing calculator platform
    - code must be re-written
        - the current ASM code may be largely unusable
        - can use C
    - must learn the ins-and-outs of a different platform

- available platforms to work with
    - TI89
        - M68k (coldfire) processor
        - tiGCC C compiler
        - USB port

    - HP49g, HP50g calculator lines (HP48g too??)
        - ARM (power) processor
            - 200 MHz
        - HPG-CC C compiler
            - filesystem, keyboard, drawing, and windowing routines
        - expandable memory
        - USB port
        - calculator OS runs in emulated Saturn5 invironment
            - may be difficult to interface with
        - underlying OS is called KOS (relative of KeyKOS??)
