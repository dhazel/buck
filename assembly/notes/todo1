x   - create the special shared and LP2 include files
x   - make BuckLP2 a stand-alone program
x   - make hooks in BC40 to test
x       - write special handover routine to test
x           -> does this work, or do we need a different method?
x               -> do we return to previous execution in the original program?
x   - copy asm files to the shared partition
x   - reboot to compile and test
x write the data sharing copy over routine
x   -> if the copy over routine can't find BC40, then have it present a short
x       message and call AboutBuck?
x check to make sure that all _winBtm and _winTop references are correct
x finish testing all "untested" routines
x fix three-column newline bug
x   -> something more is going on than newline, code appears to be good
x       -> got system crash on production TI86
x       -> the laptop compiler is acting wierd
x           -> debug this on the beast
x put testprints in to check volume problem
x   -> testprints is not being called, likely because of laptop compiler 
x       problems

5.0
x change printerrors to only print the errors that occured

x   - copyover routine
x add functionality to Buck22
x   - simple check -- do I compute the log or not?
x   -> can I easily get an index, or do I need to write the find function first?
x       -> writing the find function now is a waste of time, the Buck algorithm
x           already implements the needed functionality and is too optimized to 
x           simply shoehorn a find function 
x   - upgrade algorithm and functions
x       - volatile data reseter
x           - reset "it" to all 255's
x       - rewrite Buck
x           - use "it" for tracking the LCV placeholder
x           - code optimization for the tree "middle"
x           - re-inclusion of the iterator in main code (increments, etc)
x           - algorithm "back-step" resets "it" to 255 rather than zero
x           - add LCV overrun error checker
x       - change Price2 
x           - use the iteration tracker "it"
x               -> can I use IX (is it preserved?)? -- yes
x                   - use Jimi Malcolm's "destroy" to test all calls to builtins
x                       in Volume and Price2 before "it" is required
x       - get rid of LCV_placeholder
x           - ErrWrongLength

x           - ResetVolatileData
x           - Price2

-> It is now possible to have multiple LCV entries of the same length!!!
    -> The Buck algorithm indexes more robustly now and can handle it
x remove ErrSwitchMill
x   -> SwitchMill should do nothing when it receives a bad mill number
x warn before clearing the statistics data

x           - move PrintArrayElm into buck_subroutines_shared.asm
x       - provide options for traversal of the criteria array
x write find function ?
x   -> simple find, no criteria
x   - take input of array size
x   - take input of array start address
x   - take input of search value
x   - return status, index, address
x make sure that Price2 works with guess-compare
x   - determine the primitive function of the Price routine
x       - what should it do
x           - it *has* to be very fast and simple because of its use in Buck22
x           - it should simply be a price calculator
x               - it should be told specifically where log price data is at
x       - what should it not do
x           - it should not implement any sort of find function
x   - use the find function along with Price2 in guess-compare
x       - this may best be wrapped in a new function to ease use
x           - Price2standalone
x fix Interpolate bug
x make sure that guess-compare mode accounts for log criteria
x consolidate code with a CriteriaPassFail function
x change clearmenu and clearwindow to restore previous _winTop and _winBtm




6.0

x             - state_status variable
x                   - use 0 and 1 to designate stale or fresh data
x                       - 0 = stale data 
x                       - 1 = fresh data
x                   -> use state status variable to signal a data wipe?? no
x                   -> use state status variable to signal a data undo?? no
x           - undoable variable
x               - 0 = not undoable, redoable
x               - 1 = undoable, not redoable
x           -> the undoable variable is set by bcstpr
x       - add mill number field to the result data structure
x           - indexed from 0
x       - allow statistics undo
x           - use bcout(1,4) to hold the "undoable" status variable
x           - does not require a separate matrix
x               - use bcout(1,4) to hold the undoable status
x                   - update bcstun
x                   - update bcstpr
x                   - update bcstat

x               - check for previous undo
x               - duplicate bcstpr, but subtract rather than add
x                   - program name: "bcstun"
x       - make sure that exporting works in millcompare mode
x   - create routine to access TIOS variables simply
x       - matrices
x           - based on row and column
x               - check whether requested matrix location is present
x               - return data to OP register
x               - write data from OP register
x   - write routine to create TIOS matrix variables
x       -> needed so that matrix can be restored in case it is deleted
x   - update BuckStat
x        - determine whether to use TIBASIC or ASM elements
x            - TIBASIC:
x                - quick development
x                    - math operations are symplified
x                - simplified development
x                - editor is very small and difficult to use
x                - fairly limited presentation capabilities
x                    - can output strings and data to specific screen locations
x            - ASM:
x                - detailed control of the display
x                - likely more info in a smaller screen space
x                - can use VIM to do editing
x                - UI coding is excruciatingly complex
x                    - will take lots of time and head-work
x            - considerations:
x                - lots of math operations
x                - lots of information to display
x                - not much time available
x            - perhaps draw headers with ASM and use TIBASIC for data
x                - only if TIBASIC prog's honor previous _wintop settings
x                - best if I can display two elements per line (check this out)
x                - what about ASM draw routines called by TIBASIC progs?
x                    - would have to talk via TIOS variables
x            - use TIBASIC
x       - use the profile system
x           - display stored data
x           - remove the old data areas out of bc_data
x           - remove the ClearStats routine

x   - link the new buckstat routines into BC main
x       - bcstat
x   - remove Handoff_BCStat
x make CriteriaEditor navigation more intuitive
x   - up/down rather than right/left
x separate the Setup routines into a separate helper program
x   -> base the separations on pricing plans
x   - make BuckStup.asm file 
x       - make it a fully executable module
x   - make the subroutine file for BuckStup, buck_subroutines_stup
x   - make sure that dependencies work properly
x       - copyover_data
x       - Handoff_BuckLP2
x       - SwitchMill
x       - BuckStart
x       - test them all
x   - make sure that assembly program handoff can traverse two levels
x       -> for handing off to BuckStup to BuckLP2
x make CriteriaEditor display "  " rather than the non-descript "0" for 
x   nonexistant criteria
NOTE: the duplicate-entry check in BuckLP2 is disabled!!
/ add more shippable lengths entries
x make stat data easily saveable, "copyable"
x   - one copied mill
x       -> must be initialized or this causes errors
x           - update StatDataInit to check and initialize saved mill matrix
x               - mill name also?
x                   -> required for robustness of the statistics mill copy
x                   - place check in StringCreate
x                       - by default, throw flag and exit if string exists
x                       - have option to force overwrite
x                   - modify the existing StringCreate calls
x                       - StatDataInit
x                   - modify existing StatDataInit calls
x                       - SwitchMill
x                       - BC60
x                           - add one here
x                               - at beginning of execution, initialize 
x                                   everything
x                       - BCStup
x       - "bcsavem": saved mill matrix
x       - "bcsaven": saved mill name
x       - update bcstat
x           - save matrix and name
x           - display saved data
x   - offer the option of a pensil and paper
x include trim in display in BuckLP2
x   -> note that this only works in the current code with the current 
x       duplicate-entry check disabled
- in guess mode, start with the user's guess as the best price
    -> his should speed things up significantly
/ fix regression in BuckLP2 display (bottom line)
/   -> this display problem only happens when BuckLP2 is run standalone
x organize the code better
x   - update the include directives in programs
x       - create a dependancy autogeneration script using awk
x   - fine grained include files
x       - by individual function
x           - organize via subdirectories
x               - by functionality
x   - keep BC user interface top level
x   - simplify version tracking (file away old versions safely and easily)
x       - mercurial version control system
x   - move predefined program names out of copyover_data
x       - place them in buck_data.asm
x       - rename them to clarify what they are
x           - use "BC" in favor of "Buck"
x               -> NOTE: this also necessitates renaming many functions too
x                   -> (not completed yet)
x           - program names 
x           - labels of the name data
x           - update all routines that use the labels
x if mill data matrices are initialized (in SwitchMill), notify user that they 
x   were missing
x update the mill name data variable on every SwitchMill
x   -> minimal impact to the user, and program cost would be high to implement
x       a check
x clear the menu _after_ stat data is exported in FinMenu
x turn run indicator on for bcstat
- in guess mode, start with the user's guess as the best price
    -> his should speed things up significantly
- make tampercheck verify the existance of all of the TIBASIC programs
- design a straightforward way to maximize the length left in the woods
- prepare the Buck algorithm for upcoming enhancements
    - price skew number to be used in volume constraint framework
    - check feasability of adding grade criteria checks
        - possibly make adding such checks easier
    - switch copyblock choice function from (>=) to just (>)
        -> this will reverse the effective priority order and decrease the 
            number of runtime copyblock activations
        -> this will also enable specialized copyblock choice criteria like 
            (percent better value) or similar
        -> this may also require significant modification to BuckLP2 because of
            its indexing and selection system
            -> all of the checks are oriented toward the current reverse display
                order (that I went to great pain to implement)
        - add fancy checks to allow ties to be tracked
            



- write user manual
- determine pricing to sell the calculator


- write input function
x   -> for numbers only; strings can be input via available routines
x   -> may be able to use TIBASIC program to call the TI Input function
x       -> need to initialy checkpoint/sum the program to ensure it can not be 
x           changed without notice
x       - this will not work
x           - OP1 is used by TIOS when switching between programs
x           - obfuscation is heavy regarding how to access Input from assembler
    - write number to OP1
    - print number to screen as it is typed
        - only accept one decimal point
        - check for maximum characters
- check which routines could reference the program global constraints defines 
    and modify them to do so
- make ResetVolatileData roll "it" over to 255's more elegantly
- add log grade criteria
    - create input in user interface
x   - create log_grade input data array
    - add grade to criteria editor
x       - create grade criteria array
    - add grade criteria check
    - add grade price check
    - create grade determination function for Buck
    - create "current grade" variable for Buck
    - check LCV indexing
        -> needs to be hard indexing rather than "run-up" indexing
        - fix if necessary
- fix FinDisplay3 5-log display problem
- fix Div8~16Bit bug
    -> can this bug be recreated?
        - document recreation circumstances
- add more functions to BuckStat
    - compute tarif numbers
    - compute basal area
    - estimate DBH (diameter at breast height)
    -
- remove the duplicate check from BuckLP2
    -> this will necessitate a specialized, criteria-based find function
- write a find function for LCV elements that includes criteria values
    - take input of length, min/max criteria, and volume group
    - return status and index
- update BuckLP2 to use the InputInt function
- write volume percentage constraint framework
- rewrite BuckInput to operate more like an editor
- add interrupt timer to halt execution if too much time passes
