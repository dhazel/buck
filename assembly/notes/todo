x display volumes
x track volume
x   - create statistics program for handover
x   - add statistics configuration in BuckSetup
x       - enable/disable statistics
x   - place statistics choice handler calls in FinMenu
-> display more optimal choices?
x rearange execution in BuckLP2 to avoid menu flicker
x separate BuckLP2 out of the main program
x   - determine all shared subroutines
x   - separate out all shared subroutines
x   - write a data sharing "copy-over" routine
x   - find and experiment with the assembly program handover function
x       -> does execution return to the calling program's location and state?
x           -> if not, how can I return execution to where I need it?
x check to make sure that all _winBtm and _winTop references are correct
-> consider making a library system that can dynamically load non-speed-critical
    routines to the end of the program for execution
-> consider splitting out the setup routines into a helper program
- write input function
    -> for numbers only unless need arises for strings
    - write number to OP1
    - print number to screen as it is typed
        - only accept one decimal point
        - check for maximum characters

NOTES___________________

- 'jp m', 'jp p', 'jp po', and 'jp pe' can not be replaced with 'jr', all other 
    absolute jumps can be replaced with relative jumps.
    - right now this only affects BuckLP2, Interpolate, 
        PrintArrayElm_drawscreen, BuckInput, and TamperChk
