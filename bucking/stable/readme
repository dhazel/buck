ABOUT:
This is the second working mock-up series (version 1.0.4) of the bucking 
program into python. It generates all of its own files (with user input). 
It is relatively fast, but does not use array operators from numarray, instead 
it uses lists in conventional python style; nonetheless, it still runs 
with fair speed.


CHANGELOG:
version 0.9 --
    - simple text-based interface
version 1.0 --
    - new graphical interface
    - updated much code for OS interoperability (not perfect yet though)
version 1.0.1 --
    - improved useability (simplified)
    - should now be almost fully OS independant
version 1.0.2 --
    - much  new changes based on input from the first experimental user 
          (other than me)
    - changed the verbage used for many of the buttons and names
    - added a simple calculator to determine price of up to five input logs
          ( to be used for comparison purposes )
    - changed the way the output file records log lengths
        * now the junk log lengths are dropped off and only the lengths to be 
            cut are listed
version 1.0.4 --
    - fixed a bug in how the second choice is determined. Buck lengths shorter
        than those of the first choice had been being excluded from the second
        choice.
    



TO RUN:
To run the bucking program navigate to the directory housing the program files, make the file named 'buck.py' executable (if it is not already), 
and execute the file.
The first run will require you to input log prices.


NOTES:
The program requires the python Tkinterface, or in other words the Tkinter module.
